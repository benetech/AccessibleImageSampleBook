<h2 id="makeaccessible">Making These Images Accessible</h2>
<p class="noind">Many images don't need to be made accessible if their function in the text is purely decorative or if they convey information that is also provided in the text. </p>
<p class="ind">The first image, a graphic of an open book, is an icon used to highlight a recurring section at the end of each chapter. It is a decorative image and does not need to be made accessible. However, it should be tagged so that a screen reader will know to skip it. </p>

<section>
<h3 id="textoraudio">Text or Audio Description</h3>
<h4 id="epub3">EPUB 3</h4>
<p class="noind">The code used for this in an EPUB 3 file is: </p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code class="language-html"><span class="code1">&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" /&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>

<h4 id="daisy">DAISY</h4>
<p>In a DAISY file, the code used is: </p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code class="language-daisy"><span class="code1">&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="" /&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p class="noind">The second image is an author photo that accompanies a short biography of the author. There are two options for making this image accessible. The appropriate option depends on the accessibility of the text associated with the image. </p>
<p class="option">Option 1:</p>
<p class="noind">If the dates below the photo are live text and will be read by a screen reader, the accompanying photo can be identified with a short alt text of: "Photo of Kay Boyle." All other information is included in the caption and the box text. </p>
<p class="ind">In both DAISY and EPUB 3, the following code can be used: </p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code class="language-html"><span class="code1">&lt;img src="kayboyle.jpg" alt="Photo of Kay Boyle" /&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p class="option">Option 2:</p>
<p class="noind">If the dates below the photo are embedded in the image and will therefore not be read by a screen reader, the photo should be identified with a short alt text of: "Photo of Kay Boyle, who lived from 1902 to 1992." </p>
<p class="ind">In both DAISY and EPUB 3, the following code can be used: </p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code class="language-html"><span class="code1">&lt;img src="kayboyle.jpg" alt="Photo of Kay Boyle, who lived from 1902 to 1992" /&gt;</span></code></pre>
