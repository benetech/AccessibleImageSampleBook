<h2>Making This Image Accessible</h2>
<p class="first">This image can be made accessible with an image description. Since comics and cartoons often contain drawings, captions, and dialogue to make a joke, tell a story, or offer an opinion, description is the recommended mode of access. The description should include the setting, the characters, and enough detail to understand the cartoon. Captions and dialogue must be provided as well. As the example description shows, details and language often need to be edited or omitted to match the tone and essence of the comic or cartoon. </p>
<h3>Text or Audio Description</h3>
<p class="first">A comic strip is entitled Weekly Invention: Labor-Saving Auto Jack. It shows a man sitting in a car with an elephant on the roof and a cannon on the hood pointed backward. A ramp slants from the roof of the car down to a platform near the trunk. The platform is connected to a mechanical hand. The comic reads: When rear tire goes flat, pull string and fire peanut from cannon. Elephant sees peanut as it lands on platform. He walks down ramp and his weight causes hand to jack up tire! P.S. If you get a puncture in front tire, call a cab.</p>
