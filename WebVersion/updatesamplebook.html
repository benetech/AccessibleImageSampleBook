<h1>How to Update the Accessible Image Sample Book (HTML version)</h1>

<h2>Grab the content from GitHub</h2>
<p>You will need to visit <a href="https://github.com/benetech/AccessibleImageSampleBook">the GitHub repository</a> to obtain a copy of the master documents for the Web Version. Be sure to check out the code and commit it properly when you are done.</p>

<h2>Connect to the Diagram Center’s SFTP</h2>

<p>You will need a SFTP client. On the Mac, I use Cyberduck, which is pretty accessible with VoiceOver and keyboard access.  I hear good things about the accessibility of FileZilla for Windows and Linux systems.</p>

<p>You will need to be given the host names, username, and password for the FTP - you can see Diagram Center staff and Benetech’s IT department for this.  You just enter the username, server name, and password to connect, all other settings are likely to be the defaults.</p>

<h2>Adding new pages and editing the page number structure</h2>

<p>It is always best to update both the Web Version and the EPUB at the same time. Be sure that all of your changes are made in both versions of the files, and that you update all of the version numbers (Title Page, OPF, and Copyright page).</p>

<p>You'll need a text editor to make changes to the files; you probably have a favorite already.  I personally use Sublime Text 2 which is fairly usable with VoiceOver but not perfectly so, unfortunately.  TextMate 2.0 is an excellent choice for accessibility on the Mac.  Visual Studio Express or TextPad is pretty accessible with JAWS on Windows.</p>

<p>The following is the HTML for the page navigation:</p>
<pre>
<code>
&lt;nav&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="<i>nameofnextpage</i>.xhtml"&gt;Next Page&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;|&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&lt;a href="<i>nameofpreviouspage</i>.xhtml"&gt;Previous Page&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;|&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&lt;a href="nav.xhtml"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;|&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&lt;a href="http://diagramcenter.org/"&gt;Diagram Center Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>In some cases, you may just need to replace all or most of the current Web Version with a new copy based on the latest EPUB file's contents. Be sure to add the nav bar to the top of each page</p>

<h2>Test. No, really, test.</h2>
<p>It is super easy to muck these links up. Make sure the ones you changed all work before you upload the book to the server.</p>

<h2>Upload the whole book back to the FTP</h2>
<p>Make sure to delete the old version first, if necessary. If your FTP client has a synchronize command, you can also use that. You're done!</p>
