# Accessible Image Sample Book
The Accessible Image Sample Book, created by the [DIAGRAM Content Working Group](http://diagramcenter.org/about/working-groups.html), is a free online resource that shows you what some of the many options are for creating accessible versions of digital images such as:
- maps
- bar charts
- diagrams
- mathematical expressions
- photographs
- and more!
Each of the seven chapters in the book shows a different complex image in context of the book it came from, along with helpful tips and the code used to provide the accessible image in a digital book. See (and hear!) the different ways that an image can be made accessible, including:
- short and long descriptions
- tactile graphics
- MathML
- sonification
- audio description
- 3D printing

This resource can be used as a guide when creating accessible images in your own digital books and other digital publications. You can learn more what the book contains by listening to the [webinar about the Accessible Image Sample Book](http://diagramcenter.org/webinars.html#aisb) presented by its authors.

## Change Log

#### Version 3
- HTML5 coding and semantic structure have been updated and enhanced in many ways.
- Enhancements to EPUB 3 structure, semantics, and metadata.
- Extensive stylistic updates, including the addition of numerous styles to make the content more readable and more stylish.
- Sample images are now set up to work both with device double-tap image viewing and separate image pages when needed.
- The examples have been updated to replace the use of <details> and <summary> with <aside>. This is in keeping with the fact that those elements have been removed from the official HTML5.0 spec, thus they are technically unsupported in EPUB 3. They will probably be added back into the HTML spec with 5.1, but will not be technically valid in EPUB 3 until that happens and until EPUB 3 updates to support 5.1. See more about this here: [https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck/issues/407#issuecomment-50631597]

#####Known issues in this draft:
- Some of the "large" images are not large enough. I would like to re-create all of the images from the original source files if possible. Does someone have those source files archived?
- In Sample 4, the book says "The complete HTML5 + MathML code is available from the source files list." That sources files list document points to the download on this page [http://diagramcenter.org/standards-and-practices/accessible-image-sample-book.html]. Inside that download zip, there is an index.html file pointing to the contents of the zip, but this item in that list instead points to http://diagramcenter.org/standards-and-practices.html. This all seems a bit circular, and it appears that either the references to Sample 4 being avaialble in the resources need to be removed from all these places, or the HTML and MathML code needs to be added to the resources download.


#### Version 2
Minor updates

#### Version 1
